# SimulatedGameServer
Creating a server base on a user's PC that will allow anyone in range to connect to it.

Milestone #1: Base game - an individual should be able to play the game against another person on a single machine

Milestone #2: Game over a network - the game should have the ability to be played over a network where game states are sent over a network and 2 clients should be able to play on separate devices

Milestone #3: Lobby system / Server Hosting - the biggest milestone which implements the lobby system where a hosting client can see individuals who are nearby (based on a threshold RTT)
