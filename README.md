# SimulatedGameServer
Creating a server based on a user's PC that will allow anyone in range to connect to it.

Our team has designed a game server to play Tic Tac Toe. On startup, the user is given two options: host, or join. If the user hosts a game, a player who wants to join can search for that game if they are within range. If a user tries to join a server when none are available, they will have the ability to host the match instead. When a player decides to host a match they will open a port for the server that will listen for players looking to join. Once connected to the server, the game will communicate between the server and clients. The game packet data will include the ID, checksum, timestamp, and boardstamp in order. This communication will continue until the game has been completed, or connection is terminated.
